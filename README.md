# PureScript by Example Solutions

My solutions to the [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read)
book as I work through it. My goal is to solve every exercise while restricting
myself only to the tools and concepts introduced up to that point in the book.
File organization is by chapter, and the questions have been inlined with the
code.

## Getting Started

    $ npm install -g purescript pulp bower

See individual chapter README files for further instruction.
